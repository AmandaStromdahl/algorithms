## A more detailed project explanation
The project root folder contains various documentation and settings oriented files such as the readme and the license. We also find config files such as the .gitignore and requirement files for installation of package dependencies. It also contains configuration files for continuous delivery through github actions in the form of .yml files. Apart from this there are three main folders. The first is a folder which hosts all the algorithms. This is the main folder of the repository. The second is a folder called docs which hosts a makefile and a large collection of empty .rst files. The makefile and .rst files allows a user to generate documentation in the form of browsable html-documents or linux man-pages. The third folder of importance is the tests folder. It hosts all the 394 unittests for the project.
